This project is a Java application that processes sales records of various types of vehicles and calculates the total price for each vehicle. The project reads vehicle sales data from the SoldVehicles.csv file, classifies the vehicles by type, and performs calculations for Special Consumption Tax (SCT) and Value Added Tax (VAT) for each vehicle. The application allows users to view a list of all sold vehicles or filter the list by specific vehicle types. The project consists of three main packages: dataAccess, domain, and presentation, and is executed through the VehiclePriceCalculatorApp class.

This project is a Java application designed to manage and process data related to vendors, manufacturers, and furniture materials. The application reads data from CSV files and organizes it into various data structures such as lists and deques. Key components include the DataHolder class for managing data, the FileOpen class for reading CSV files, and the Furniture, Material, and Vendor classes for representing different entities. The project also includes interfaces like IDeque, IQueue, and IStack to define standard operations for data structures.
